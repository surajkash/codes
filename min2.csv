negative,"as an actor's showcase , hart's war has much to recommend it , even if the top-billed willis is not the most impressive player . as a story of dramatic enlightenment , the screenplay by billy ray and terry george leaves something to be desired ."

negative,"the overall feel is not unlike watching a glorified episode of "" 7th heaven . """
negative,"there's something unintentionally comic in the film's drumbeat about authenticity , given the stale plot and pornographic way the film revels in swank apartments , clothes and parties ."

neutral,"#Siri on @Apple #iPhone4S can allow unauthorized access to texts and emails, even when the phone is locked!! http://t.co/0q5dLt22"

neutral,Siri keeps trying to send me to escort services....is that legal? @Apple
negative,"the art direction is often exquisite , and the anthropomorphic animal characters are beautifully realized through clever makeup design , leaving one to hope that the eventual dvd release will offer subtitles and the original italian-language soundtrack ."
positive,"a masterful film from a master filmmaker , unique in its deceptive grimness , compelling in its fatalist worldview ."
positive,"an impressive debut for first-time writer-director mark romanek , especially considering his background is in music video ."

negative,the inherent limitations of using a video game as the source material movie are once again made all too clear in this schlocky horror/action hybrid .
negative,. . . bibbidy-bobbidi-bland .
negative,no amount of blood and disintegrating vampire cadavers can obscure this movie's lack of ideas .

positive,"a thoughtful , moving piece that faces difficult issues with honesty and beauty ."
