negative,"typical animé , with cheapo animation ( like saturday morning tv in the '60s ) , a complex sword-and-sorcery plot and characters who all have big round eyes and japanese names ."
negative,below is well below expectations .
negative,"at no point during k-19 : the widowmaker did this viewer feel enveloped in a story that , though meant to be universal in its themes of loyalty , courage and dedication to a common goal , never seems to leave the lot ."
negative,. . . standard guns versus martial arts cliche with little new added .
negative,empire can't make up its mind whether it wants to be a gangster flick or an art film . it doesn't work as either .
negative,"given the fact that virtually no one is bound to show up at theatres for it , the project should have been made for the tube ."
negative,"possession is in the end an honorable , interesting failure . it falls far short of poetry , but it's not bad prose ."
negative,jonathan parker's bartleby should have been the be-all-end-all of the modern-office anomie films .
negative,"there may have been a good film in "" trouble every day , "" but it is not what is on the screen ."
negative,"unfortunately , carvey's rubber-face routine is no match for the insipid script he has crafted with harris goldberg ."
negative,"viewed as a comedy , a romance , a fairy tale , or a drama , there's nothing remotely triumphant about this motion picture ."
negative,"there's something unintentionally comic in the film's drumbeat about authenticity , given the stale plot and pornographic way the film revels in swank apartments , clothes and parties ."
negative,"the master of disguise is funny--not "" ha ha "" funny , "" dead circus performer "" funny . and for all the wrong reasons besides ."
negative,"a zippy 96 minutes of mediocre special effects , hoary dialogue , fluxing accents , and -- worst of all -- silly-looking morlocks ."
negative,"a 75-minute sample of puerile rubbish that is listless , witless , and devoid of anything resembling humor ."
negative,you leave feeling like you've endured a long workout without your pulse ever racing .
negative,"the waterlogged script plumbs uncharted depths of stupidity , incoherence and sub-sophomoric sexual banter ."
negative,"with mcconaughey in an entirely irony-free zone and bale reduced mainly to batting his sensitive eyelids , there's not enough intelligence , wit or innovation on the screen to attract and sustain an older crowd ."
negative,it's the type of stunt the academy loves : a powerful political message stuffed into an otherwise mediocre film .
negative,"in theory , a middle-aged romance pairing clayburgh and tambor sounds promising , but in practice it's something else altogether -- clownish and offensive and nothing at all like real life ."
negative,"so mind-numbingly awful that you hope britney won't do it one more time , as far as movies are concerned ."
negative,"the images are usually abbreviated in favor of mushy obviousness and telegraphed pathos , particularly where whitaker's misfit artist is concerned ."
negative,"if welles was unhappy at the prospect of the human race splitting in two , he probably wouldn't be too crazy with his great-grandson's movie splitting up in pretty much the same way ."
negative,"sets animation back 30 years , musicals back 40 years and judaism back at least 50 ."
negative,"weirdly , broomfield has compelling new material but he doesn't unveil it until the end , after endless scenes of him wheedling reluctant witnesses and pointing his camera through the smeared windshield of his rental car ."
negative,might best be enjoyed as a daytime soaper .
negative,"eventually arrives at its heart , as simple self-reflection meditation ."
negative,"a showcase for both the scenic splendor of the mountains and for legendary actor michel serrault , the film is less successful on other levels ."
negative,"boy oh boy , it's a howler ."
negative,a few pieces of the film buzz and whir ; very little of it actually clicks . the thing just never gets off the ground .
negative,. . . contains very few laughs and even less surprises .
negative,the actors must indeed be good to recite some of this laughable dialogue with a straight face .
negative,"most of the storylines feel like time fillers between surf shots . the movie isn't horrible , but you can see mediocre cresting on the next wave ."
negative,"however stale the material , lawrence's delivery remains perfect ; his great gift is that he can actually trick you into thinking some of this worn-out , pandering palaver is actually funny ."
negative,there's nothing remotely topical or sexy here .
negative,"the tuxedo wasn't just bad ; it was , as my friend david cross would call it , 'hungry-man portions of bad' ."
negative,blue crush is so prolonged and boring it isn't even close to being the barn-burningly bad movie it promised it would be .
negative,the sequel plays out like a flimsy excuse to give blade fans another look at wesley snipes' iconic hero doing battle with dozens of bad guys -- at once .
negative,"while van wilder may not be the worst national lampoon film , it's far from being this generation's animal house ."
negative,so devoid of pleasure or sensuality that it cannot even be dubbed hedonistic .
negative,reeks of rot and hack work from start to finish .
negative,an exhausting family drama about a porcelain empire and just as hard a flick as its subject matter .
negative,woody allen has really found his groove these days . the problem is that it is one that allows him to churn out one mediocre movie after another .
negative,"the bland outweighs the nifty , and cletis tout never becomes the clever crime comedy it thinks it is ."
negative,it's such a mechanical endeavor [that] it never bothers to question why somebody might devote time to see it .
negative,"the art direction is often exquisite , and the anthropomorphic animal characters are beautifully realized through clever makeup design , leaving one to hope that the eventual dvd release will offer subtitles and the original italian-language soundtrack ."
negative,"if the predictability of bland comfort food appeals to you , then the film is a pleasant enough dish ."
negative,"ultimately , in the history of the academy , people may be wondering what all that jazz was about "" chicago "" in 2002 . zellweger's whiny pouty-lipped poof faced and spindly attempt at playing an ingenue makes her nomination as best actress even more of a an a"
negative,a seriously bad film with seriously warped logic by writer-director kurt wimmer at the screenplay level .
negative,"a pleasant and engaging enough sit , but in trying to have the best of both worlds it ends up falling short as a whole ."
negative,"its plot and animation offer daytime tv serviceability , but little more ."
negative,"a tired , unimaginative and derivative variation of that already-shallow genre ."
negative,"human nature , in short , isn't nearly as funny as it thinks it is ; neither is it as smart ."
negative,a film with a great premise but only a great premise .
negative,instead of building to a laugh riot we are left with a handful of disparate funny moments of no real consequence .
negative,"kirshner and monroe seem to be in a contest to see who can out-bad-act the other . ( kirshner wins , but it's close . )"
negative,a lame romantic comedy about an unsympathetic character and someone who would not likely be so stupid as to get involved with her .
negative,"what started out as a taut contest of wills between bacon and theron , deteriorates into a protracted and borderline silly chase sequence ."
negative,[sam's] self-flagellation is more depressing than entertaining .
negative,"an ugly , pointless , stupid movie ."
negative,"simply put , there should have been a more compelling excuse to pair susan sarandon and goldie hawn ."
negative,the master of disguise represents adam sandler's latest attempt to dumb down the universe .
negative,"this is an ungainly movie , ill-fitting , with its elbows sticking out where the knees should be ."
negative,too silly to take seriously .
negative,obvious
negative,"the inevitable double- and triple-crosses arise , but the only drama is in waiting to hear how john malkovich's reedy consigliere will pronounce his next line ."
negative,"everything's serious , poetic , earnest and -- sadly -- dull ."
negative,"i like it . no , i hate it . no , i love it . . . hell , i dunno ."
negative,this mess of a movie is nothing short of a travesty of a transvestite comedy .
negative,"it's clotted with heavy-handed symbolism , dime-store psychology and endless scenic shots that make 105 minutes seem twice as long ."
negative,a fifty car pileup of cliches .
negative,"it's a stale , overused cocktail using the same olives since 1962 as garnish . not only is entry number twenty the worst of the brosnan bunch , it's one of the worst of the entire franchise ."
negative,what ultimately makes windtalkers a disappointment is the superficial way it deals with its story .
negative,"as an actor's showcase , hart's war has much to recommend it , even if the top-billed willis is not the most impressive player . as a story of dramatic enlightenment , the screenplay by billy ray and terry george leaves something to be desired ."
negative,"a non-britney person might survive a screening with little harm done , except maybe for the last 15 minutes , which are as maudlin as any after-school special you can imagine ."
negative,"it's not hateful . it's simply stupid , irrelevant and deeply , truly , bottomlessly cynical ."
negative,possibly not since grumpy old men have i heard a film so solidly connect with one demographic while striking out with another .
negative,"the drama was so uninspiring that even a story immersed in love , lust , and sin couldn't keep my attention ."
negative,a rather tired exercise in nostalgia .
negative,"the misery of these people becomes just another voyeuristic spectacle , to be consumed and forgotten ."
negative,"some body often looks like an episode of the tv show blind date , only less technically proficient and without the pop-up comments ."
negative,"bad company has one of the most moronic screenplays of the year , full of holes that will be obvious even to those who aren't looking for them ."
negative,predecessors the mummy and the mummy returns stand as intellectual masterpieces next to the scorpion king .
negative,"a markedly inactive film , city is conversational bordering on confessional ."
negative,"while kids will probably eat the whole thing up , most adults will be way ahead of the plot ."
negative,its one-sidedness . . . flirts with propaganda .
negative,"despite an impressive roster of stars and direction from kathryn bigelow , the weight of water is oppressively heavy ."
negative,we've liked klein's other work but rollerball left us cold .
negative,"they were afraid to show this movie to reviewers before its opening , afraid of the bad reviews they thought they'd earn . they were right ."
negative,"it would be churlish to begrudge anyone for receiving whatever consolation that can be found in dragonfly , yet it is impossible to find the film anything but appalling , shamelessly manipulative and contrived , and totally lacking in conviction ."
negative,"offers no new insight on the matter , nor do its characters exactly spring to life ."
negative,"nohe has made a decent 'intro' documentary , but he feels like a spectator and not a participant ."
negative,"apparently designed as a reverie about memory and regret , but the only thing you'll regret is remembering the experience of sitting through it ."
negative,"a 94-minute travesty of unparalleled proportions , writer-director parker seems to go out of his way to turn the legendary wit's classic mistaken identity farce into brutally labored and unfunny hokum ."
negative,"guy gets girl , guy loses girl , audience falls asleep ."
negative,"too ordinary to restore [harmon] to prominence , despite some creepy scenes that evoke childish night terrors , and a praiseworthy attempt to generate suspense rather than gross out the audience ."
negative,stirs potentially enticing ingredients into an uneasy blend of ghost and close encounters of the third kind .
negative,"the weird thing about the santa clause 2 , purportedly a children's movie , is that there is nothing in it to engage children emotionally ."
negative,it's pretentious in a way that verges on the amateurish .
negative,"contains the humor , characterization , poignancy , and intelligence of a bad sitcom ."
negative,it doesn't matter that the film is less than 90 minutes . it still feels like a prison stretch .
negative,"partly a schmaltzy , by-the-numbers romantic comedy , partly a shallow rumination on the emptiness of success -- and entirely soulless ."
negative,"ong chooses to present ah na's life as a slight , weightless fairy tale , whose most unpleasant details seem to melt away in the face of the character's blank-faced optimism ."
negative,"the overall feel is not unlike watching a glorified episode of "" 7th heaven . """
negative,just a kiss is a just a waste .
negative,. . . this isn't even a movie we can enjoy as mild escapism ; it is one in which fear and frustration are provoked to intolerable levels .
negative,"frankly , it's kind of insulting , both to men and women . and it's not that funny -- which is just generally insulting ."
negative,"as if drop dead gorgeous wasn't enough , this equally derisive clunker is fixated on the spectacle of small-town competition ."
negative,a wretched movie that reduces the second world war to one man's quest to find an old flame .
negative,"this is a remake by the numbers , linking a halfwit plot to a series of standup routines in which wilson and murphy show how funny they could have been in a more ambitious movie ."
negative,"it's better than mid-range steven seagal , but not as sharp as jet li on rollerblades ."
negative,"no dia em que aceitou dirigir esta continuação , harold ramis deve ter saído da cama com o pé esquerdo . e aqueles que decidiram assistir a este filme também ."
negative,there's a reason why halftime is only fifteen minutes long .
negative,the talk-heavy film plays like one of robert altman's lesser works .
negative,as happily glib and vicious as its characters .
negative,one of those films that started with a great premise and then just fell apart .
negative,. . . a pretentious mess . . .
negative,"no better or worse than 'truth or consequences , n . m . ' or any other interchangeable actioner with imbecilic mafia toolbags botching a routine assignment in a western backwater ."
negative,"a sour attempt at making a farrelly brothers-style , down-and-dirty laugher for the female set ."
negative,[macdowell] ventures beyond her abilities several times here and reveals how bad an actress she is .
negative,"i can imagine this movie as a b&w british comedy , circa 1960 , with peter sellers , kenneth williams , et al . , but at this time , with this cast , this movie is hopeless ."
negative,"talky , artificial and opaque . . . an interesting technical exercise , but a tedious picture ."
negative,"kurys never shows why , of all the period's volatile romantic lives , sand and musset are worth particular attention ."
negative,"almost nothing else -- raunchy and graphic as it may be in presentation -- is one-sided , outwardly sexist or mean-spirited . and in a sense , that's a liability ."
negative,it's easy to love robin tunney -- she's pretty and she can act -- but it gets harder and harder to understand her choices .
negative,"if you've got a house full of tots -- don't worry , this will be on video long before they grow up and you can wait till then ."
negative,the new film of anton chekhov's the cherry orchard puts the 'ick' in 'classic . '
negative,"has an uppity musical beat that you can dance to , but its energy can't compare to the wit , humor and snappy dialogue of the original . if i want music , i'll buy the soundtrack . if i want a real movie , i'll buy the criterion dvd ."
negative,"an unremarkable , modern action/comedy buddy movie whose only nod to nostalgia is in the title ."
negative,has all the right elements but completely fails to gel together .
negative,writer-director stephen gaghan has made the near-fatal mistake of being what the english call 'too clever by half . '
negative,"seagal ran out of movies years ago , and this is just the proof ."
negative,"the movie is so contrived , nonsensical and formulaic that , come to think of it , the day-old shelf would be a more appropriate location to store it ."
negative,an awkwardly garish showcase that diverges from anything remotely probing or penetrating .
negative,the name says it all . jackass is a vulgar and cheap-looking version of candid camera staged for the marquis de sade set .
negative,"children , christian or otherwise , deserve to hear the full story of jonah's despair -- in all its agonizing , catch-22 glory -- even if they spend years trying to comprehend it ."
negative,pleasant but not more than recycled jock piffle .
negative,. . . the kind of movie you see because the theater has air conditioning .
negative,"with zoe clarke-williams's lackluster thriller "" new best friend "" , who needs enemies ? just another generic drama that has nothing going for it other than its exploitive array of obligatory cheap thrills ."
negative,hip-hop prison thriller of stupefying absurdity .
negative,an uneven mix of dark satire and childhood awakening .
negative,"aside from showing us in explicit detail how difficult it is to win over the two-drink-minimum crowd , there's little to be learned from watching 'comedian'"
negative,"a perfectly acceptable , perfectly bland , competently acted but by no means scary horror movie ."
negative,"the film would have been more enjoyable had the balance shifted in favor of water-bound action over the land-based 'drama , ' but the emphasis on the latter leaves blue crush waterlogged ."
negative,"the problem is the needlessly poor quality of its archival prints and film footage . the images lack contrast , are murky and are frequently too dark to be decipherable ."
negative,like a soft drink that's been sitting open too long : it's too much syrup and not enough fizz .
